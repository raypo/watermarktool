# Watermarktool Privacy Policy

Watermarktool takes your privacy very seriously. All images data you select will only be used locally on the device, and no data will be uploaded (Watermarktool is a full local stand-alone application, no remote server). And no user behavior or application usage statistics are generated or uploaded.

### What personal information we collect or access

- Watermarktool is completely a local stand-alone application, so it does not collect any of your personal information and does not access any other information of your device.


We may update our privacy policy at any time. If there are major changes to our privacy policy, we will update our privacy policy on this page(https://github.com/raypo/watermarktool/blob/main/privacy-en.md).
